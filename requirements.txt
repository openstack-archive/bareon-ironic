# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
oslo.service>=1.10.0  # Apache-2.0
ironic-lib>=2.2.0  # Apache-2.0

# Since Ironic is not published to pip and deny to use links in dependencies
# ironic dependency is defined into tox.ini
